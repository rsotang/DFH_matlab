Dose-function histogram tool for radiotherapy planning

This is an individual project that's begging as a master thesis and will extend into a PhD thesis. 
The aim of this project is to make available OS code for functional radiotherapy dosimetry. The functionality of the tool will be upgraded as time passes.
